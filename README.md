WebRTC Demos
============


Setup
-----

WebRTC requires you to serve your files from a webserver, so you can just open the HTML in the browser. Here are a few simple ways to get these demos running.

### Python

From the root director of this project, run this command from the command line:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

This will start a web in the directory and server all folder under it.

### Node

Install the `http-server` module

```
(sudo) npm install -g http-server
```
From the root director of this project, run this command from the command line:

```
http-server -p 8080
```

This will start a web in the directory and server all folder under it.
